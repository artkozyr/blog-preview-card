## ðŸ“š What I learned

This project helped me practice building a reusable card component with semantic HTML and modern CSS.  
I reinforced my skills with:

- Flexbox for vertical and horizontal alignment
- Responsive units (`rem`, `%`) and media queries
- Hover states for links and buttons
- Custom cursor icon implementation  

```css
.btn:hover {
  cursor: url(./images/pointer-icon.png) 12 3, auto;
}
